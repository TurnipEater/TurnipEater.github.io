<p>I wanted a simple sort the list activity that could be used on my LMS without the need for logging in.</p>
<p><a href="sortable demo 2.html" target="_blank">This basic demo</a> is just intended to give a visual idea of how the page works. Every time an item in the list is moved to a new place the answers are updated.</p>
<p><a href="sortable demo 1.html" target="_blank">This developed demo</a> and <a href="sortable Hamlet.html" target="_blank">the Hamlet example</a> show how the page might be used.</p>
<p>Both the developed demo and the Hamlet example contain the full code (the basic demo doesn't) and it is a simple matter to copy the source from either page and put in whatever items are required.</p>
<p>Within the source there are various options that can be selected:</p>
<ul>
       
       
<li style="margin: 10px">You can decide whether to allow the user to choose and switch between assessment based on sequential accuracy or positional accuracy. The demo has this turned on. If it is turned off you can set the preference one way or the other.</li>
<li style="margin: 10px"> When sequential accuracy has been selected you can also decide whether the first item in the list is considered. If it is then the feedback will have an appropriately coloured line above the first item and it will also be counted towards the score. If it isn't there will be no line and the score will be out of the total number of items less one. </li>
<li style="margin: 10px">If sequential accuracy has been selected then it is also possible to decide whether the feedback items are in boxes, as in the demos, or whether they are displayed as plain text. In some circumstances this might have a cleaner look.</li>
<li style="margin: 10px">You can decide whether or not the score is displayed. Since the scores are not being collected and in most instances the user will easily see that they got, for example, 3 out of 4 correct, it might be judged that displaying the score is a distraction from the purpose i.e. completing the task accurately.</li>
